Thirty-three entries. I think this will be my last one for a while.
I took advantage of the downpour and went on a long walk. It was windy, wet, and brutally cold — but also isolated and peaceful. No one around to see.
I walked down the river path, listening to music and reflecting on the life I’ve lived.

I reflected on us — the amazing time we once shared, the years of connection that can never be replaced.
I reflected on you — accepting that you're gone and how I cried over the woman I thought you were.
I reflected on myself — on how much I've grown, for once not resorting to short-term highs.

Life is short. Too short to stay trapped in the past, yet too short to sprint too far into the future.
I’m tired of running. So tired.

For months I tried to win you back in the only way I knew how — by running and ignoring what lay underneath.
For years I tried to find happiness the same way.

In the end, we only found a critical collapse.

As painful and scary as it is, I’ll break those rules and make new ones — fight the battles I created and stand my ground.

The only good thing running ever gave me was running into you. But I sure as hell aint running back. 

Our story is over now, and if the chance ever comes for it to continue... well i dont know.

I love you — and I love myself too. But you need to love you.

I'll be coming today to see the cold myself. I expect rejection. I plan to cry- to show her that i can, she always doubted whether I truly felt for her. To show I'm not cold even though the ego in me says not to shed a tear. I just know that when I do, I'm gonna do it standing.

It's not to get her back. Shes not the woman for me. Its to send a message, that I cared and that I'm sorry.

This is my letter, my soul, my love, and my grief.

I’m better now. And I'm saying that for me.

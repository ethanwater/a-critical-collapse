I saw your reddit. Here are my thoughts.

I never wanted to "show off" my new life. I wanted to show you that you can be a part of it again. I wanted you to see that this can be another home for you.

Bumble, talking to boys, isn't going to make you love yourself. You have to love yourself first before you make the same mistake. Remember when your mom was worried that you were boy crazy? Stop relying on men to prove your self worth. It's lame and below you.

Alot of the redditors gave good advice but alot of them clearly projected their own traumas too. Reddit is a helpful place but they're strangers.

The letter from my wouldve-been wife broke me. But seeing you repeat the same mistakes makes me hurt. If love is wanting the best for someone then stop making our love mean nothing.

You told me you were in school, I was so happy until i found out that was a lie. Please get back asap, the classrooms need you and YOU need you.

If this is the "growth" you cut me out your life for then maybe I didn't mean much at all. I was just the first guy you caught.

Even now i still love you.

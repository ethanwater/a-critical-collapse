I saw your reddit. Here are my thoughts.

I never intended to show off my new life. I only wanted you to see that you could still be part of it — that it could be a home for you again if you ever chose that.

The letter from my would-have-been wife was painful, but watching you keep some of the same patterns hurts even more. If love means wanting the best for someone, then I hope you stop running backwards.

Dating, attention, or external validation won’t create self-love. That has to come from within. I remember when your mom worried you were too focused on relationships — maybe she saw what I didn’t. You don’t need others to define your worth. You'll only hurt them and yourself even more than what you experienced with us.

You're too beautiful and smart for that. Chasing what's familiar will only worsen it. Take it from the guy who's done that too many times.

You told me you were in school, and I was proud — until I realized it wasn’t true. It wasn’t the lie itself that mattered, but what it represented. You said you wanted to focus on yourself and not date others because you knew of what it'd cause, yet you've lost that sight too. Being on dating apps, something you once considered cheap and empty says enough. Delete the apps and focus on whats real- the people you meet not what the algorithm feeds.

I was unaware of how deep your insecurities ran. My mother was actually the one who helped me see it — not out of judgment, but from observation. I’m not saying what happened between us was because of that- I played my part. But it’s clear that until you confront those patterns, nothing healthy can be truly built on top of them. 

If this is the growth you cut me out for then maybe what we had didn’t mean what you believed it did.

I no longer care to rebuild things.

Even so, I still care for you — just from afar.

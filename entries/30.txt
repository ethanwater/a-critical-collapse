I saw your reddit. Here are my thoughts.

I never wanted to "show off" my new life. I wanted to show you that you can be a part of it again. I wanted you to see that this can be another home for you.

Bumble, talking to boys, isn't going to make you love yourself. You have to love yourself first before you make the same mistake. Remember when your mom was worried that you were boy crazy? Stop relying on men to prove your self worth. It's lame and below you.

Alot of the redditors gave good advice but alot of them clearly projected their own traumas too. Reddit is a helpful place but they're strangers.

The letter from my wouldve-been wife broke me. But seeing you repeat the same mistakes makes me happy that it was a "would've been". But I'm only telling myself that because I hate myself for loving you. I hate seeing you make the same mistakes.

If this is the "growth" you cut me out your life for then i maybe i didn't mean much at all. I was just the first guy you caught.

Even now i still love you.
